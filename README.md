Soon I will be looking for a new job, so if you need a talented developer (or know somebody who needs one) then feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail@liarprincess.me). I'm thankful for any referrals (many companies also give a bonus to the referent).

### 👔 5 years of experience
- Mostly in big [ERP systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) in `C#` and `MSSQL`.
- A lot of work on testing, including writing a custom integration test engine that shortened the testing phase from 3h of manual work to 30s.
- Main developer on the major re-write on a project that payed the bills of the entire department (later we learned that *it was not a joke*).
- Once I wrote a driver for a payment terminal!
- Nothing open-source because that was the company policy, though I wrote [Toggl-Jira
sync](https://github.com/LiarPrincess/Toggl-Jira) which later became a company standard.

### 🎓 MSc in computer science
- Final grade “5.0 - very good” (best possible).
- Multiple scholarships through the whole education process.
- Thesis: *“Digital signal processing for music transcription”* - converter from `.mp3` file to chords/tabs (like [Capo](https://supermegaultragroovy.com/products/capo/)). Trained on The Beatles corpus from [Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange](https://www.music-ir.org/mirex/wiki/MIREX_HOME), did not start in the challenge though.

### 🦄  Open source

- [Violet - Python VM written in Swift](https://github.com/LiarPrincess/Violet)
  - Implements most of the features from Python 3.7 - missing `yield`, `async/await` and comprehensions.
  - One of the biggest open-sourced Swift repositories in terms of scope and lines-of-code.
  - Custom `BigInt` type that uses some advanced Swift features like tagged pointers and `ManagedBufferPointer` (design is similar to `smi` in [V8](https://github.com/v8/v8), though they do that on the pointer-to-js-object level).

- [Wroclive - Real-time public transport in Wrocław](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/wroclive/id1533532240)
  - iOS app that shows real-time locations of trams/buses in my local city.
  - Sends push notifications for all of the “tree is blocking the road, so the replacement bus was dispatched” events.
  - Used daily by ~5000 people.
  - #71 in “Navigation” category in polish AppStore (which is pretty nice for an app that supports only 1 city).
  - Fully open-sourced: [client](https://github.com/LiarPrincess/Wroclive-client)/[server](https://github.com/LiarPrincess/Wroclive-server).

- [Swift plays Pokemon - Game Boy emulator](https://github.com/LiarPrincess/Swift-plays-Pokemon)
  - Runs “Tetris”, “Pokemon”, “Legend of Zelda - The Links Awakening” and a few other titles.
  - Safe from *Meltdown* and *Spectre*.

### Other
- 🇵🇱 PL citizenship, happy to reallocate.
- I can reverse a linked list! But only a doubly linked list though.

Currently an owner of a small non-IT related business 🧵🧶, but as it turns out that does not go well with *current word situation*.
